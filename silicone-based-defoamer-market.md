Silicone defoamer or silicone antifoam are polymers with silicon backbones and are used to prevent foam from developing. Foaming is a phenomenon which frequently occurs during several manufacturing processes. Foam formation during the manufacturing process interrupts the production processes, reduces the effective volumes in the production plant, leads to unnecessary downtimes and at times even interferes with the application process. This creates the need for the use of defoamer or antifoaming agent to prevent the foam formation. Foam is tough to breakdown as they are stabilized by the surface viscosity and surface elasticity of their film. Silicones have low surface and interfacial tension which enables them to flow easily over the film. Apart from aqueous foaming mediums, the silicone defoamers are also suitable in non-aqueous foaming systems like crude oil, which provides for their usage in mining applications as well. Silicone defoamers provide few additional benefits over other organic types of defoamers since they are insoluble in most systems, they tend to react less with other process ingredient and perform longer and more efficiently in the foaming medium.
