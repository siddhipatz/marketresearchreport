Glass for Solar Cells Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2030

The global Glass for Solar Cells market was valued at US$ 3896.6 million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ 4781.5 million by 2029, at a CAGR of 3.0% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.

Glass for solar cells is generally used as an encapsulation sheet for solar modules to protect solar cells. After the solar cell is installed in the solar panel, the conversion efficiency will be reduced because the encapsulating glass absorbs and reflects sunlight. Therefore, in order to minimize the reflection and absorption of sunlight so that more sunlight can pass through the protective glass and hit the solar cell, the quality of the encapsulation glass is very important. Because of this unique feature, as the global use of solar energy continues to rise and the installation of solar modules and panels increases, there is an even greater demand for specialized, high-quality and high-transparency solar glass products.
